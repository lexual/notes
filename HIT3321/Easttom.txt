major threat - DoS and virus, not hackers
most hackers are fairly mediocre, limited number of truly talented hackers out
    there
IN PRACTICE: Assessing Your Own System
    * Give score out of ten for: how high profile company is and
        value of information
        e.g. 7 credit card info, 10 nuclear
        9 govt, 3 little known company
    * add 2 numbers to get number out of 20
    * rate your current security out of 10
    * subtract 2nd number from 1st (-8 to 18)
        lower number, better security
top threats to networks
    malware
        software with malicious purpose
        virus attacks
            most common attack
            "a small program that replicates and hides itself inside other
                programs, usually without your knowledge" -- Symantec 2003
            like biological virus: both replicate and spread
            often spread by emailing your address book.
            may not harm system, but cause network slowdown/shutdowns.
            new viruses created each month
        trojan horses
            appears to be benign but secretly downloads virus/malware
        spyware
            software that spies on you
            e.g. cookie - your web history
            key logger - logs all keystrokes
                can also do regular screen shots
        most prevalent danger to system
    intrusion
        gain unauthorised access to system
        cracking - correct word to use - gaining access w/ malevolent intent
        hacking - gaining access, may not be malevolent
        social engineering
            exploit human nature not technology
            con artist methods
            e.g. ring up and ask for passwords
            TEXT:
                The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security
                Kevin Mitnick
        war-dialing
            set computer to call phone numbers until another computer answers
                and try to gain entry to its system.
            war-driving
                wifi
                drive around finding vulnerable wireless networks
    DoS - Denial of Service
        2nd most common attack after malware
        flood with false connection requests
        prevent legitimate access to system
internal employeese misusing system
    misuse, or outright attack
people
    hacker - expert on system
        white hat - find vulnerability, disclose to vendor
        black hat - gain access, malicious intent
            aka cracker
        grey hat - e.g. gain access to corporation they think are unethical
    script kiddy - hacker without expertise
    sneaker - legally hack into system to assess system's vulnerability
        author thinks should hire these to look at your network each year
        should have criminial background check
devices
    firewall - barrier between network and outside world
        filters traffic going in and out
    proxy server - hide internal IP address, present single IP to outside
        intercepts all requests and fulfils it if it can
        improve performance and filter requests
    IDS - Intrusion Detection System
        monitors traffic for suspicious activity that might be an intrusion
        e.g. detect someone scanning all ports to see which are open
activities
    phreaking - break into telephone system
        "The action of using mischievous and mostly illegal ways in order to not
        pay for some sort of telecommunications bill, order, transfer, or
        other service"
        -- New Hacker's Dictionary
    authentication
        determine whether credentials given (username/password) are authorised
            to access the resources they're trying to access
    auditing
        reviewing logs, records, procedures to see if they meet standards
approach to network
    perimeter
        bulk of security efforts are focused here
        firewalls, proxy servers, password policies
        anything to make unauthorise access less likely
        secure perimeter, not secure inside of network
    layered
        secure individual systems within network as well as perimeter
        preferred method
        segment network, and secure each segment
reactive vs proactive security
    wait until you're attacked before implementing security measures.
    responding to attack or preventitive measures
    proactive - IDS
hybrid
    actually a mix of reactive/proactive, layered/perimeter
legal implications
    privacy laws - if compromised health insurance data, are you liable?
Online resources
    CERT - Computer Emergency Response Team - www.cert.org
        sponsored by Carnegie-Mellon University
        should visit site routinely
        first computer incident-response team

    ethernet card/wifi card.
MAC addresses
    Media Access Control Addresses
    Unique for each NIC in the world
    6 byte hexadecimal number

    packets sent to each computer connected to it
    layer 1 device
Switch
    an intelligent hub
    only sends out the port the dest computer is on
    builds table based on MAC addresses
    layer 2 device
Router
    connects 2 or more networks
    can program and control how they relay packets
T1 - 1.54 Megabits per second
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
    2 hosts to establish connection and exchange data
    guarantees in order delivery
IP - Internet Protocl
    specifies packet format and addressing scheme.
UDP - User Datagram Protocol
    connectionless protocol
    uses IP
    few error recovery services
    doesn't guarantee delivery
ICMP
    Internet Control Message Protocol
    extension of IP
    packets containing error,info, control messages.
    ping uses ICMP
Common application layer protocols and ports
    20,21   ftp
    23      telnet
    53      dns
    80      http

    32-bit address, x.x.x.x between 0-255
    4 bytes
    public and private
    no 2 public addresses can be the same
    classes
        1st byte tells whether class A,B,C
        127.*.*.*   reserved
        A 000-126.*.*.* extremely large networks
        B 128-191.*.*.* large corporate and government networks
        C 192-223.*.*.* most common, your isp probably has these
        D 224-247.*.*.* reserved for multicasting (transmitting to multiple)
        E 248-255.*.*.* reserved for experimental use.
    127.0.0.1 loopback (your machine)

    share common address component (subnet
    IP address w/ same prefix
    e.g. all IP beginning 200.200.200
    subnet mask
        32 bits
        tells which part of address is refer to subnet (network) and host
        e.g.
        class B 185.201.20.2
            185.201 subnet
            20.2 host
web server errors
    400 series are client errors
    500 series are server errors
    100 series are informational
    200 series indicate sucess
    300 series are re-directional
ipconfig
    tells ip address
    ipconfig -?
        gives help on options
        e.g. ipconfig /all
            gives more info
ping
    sends echo packet to see if reachable
tracert/traceroute
    tells you route that ping took
    does this by sending w/ different increasing ttl amounts
converting decimal to binary
    31/2    15  r1
    15/2    7   r1
    7/2     3   r1
    3/2     1   r1
    1/2     0   r1
    binary: 00011111
firewall    
    barrier between your network and internet
    mainly work by packet filtering
    only allow packts using certain types of protocols through
proxy server
    hides your netowk from outside
    all traffic goes through here, addresses changed
firewall + proxy server is basic internet security
