** Intrusion Detection Terminology
Alerts/events
    sent to system operator when suspicious activity detected
ArachNIDS
    (Advanced Reference Archive of Current Heuristics for Network Intrusion
    Detection Systems)
    attack profile db for Network IDSes
Automated/Active Response
    automatically defend against attack when detected
Blacklist
    list of addresses to block/monitor considered a threat
CIDF
    Common Intrusion Detection Framework
    standardizing IDS by developing protocol/application programming interfaces
CISL
    Common Intrusion Specification Language
    language for CIDF components to talk to each other
Content Monitoring
    url/email filtering
Consoles
    disprse IDS sensors report to central console
CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
    standardizing names for vulnerabililies
DeepSight Analyzer and DeepSight TMS (Threat Management System)
    free SecurityFocus/Symantec service to anonymously pass on network security
    events, used in DeepSight
Enumeration
    probing network to discover hosts and services that are present
Evasion
    attacking and getting by IDS noticing.
False Negatives/Miss
    attack not detected or considered benign
False Positives/False Alarm
    alerted as attack but actually benign
Fragmentation
    breaking up packet if differing MTU (max transmission unit)
    been used to evade IDS
Heuristics
    use AI to detect intrusions
Honeynet Project
    network of production systems designed to be compromised so they can 
    analyze the attack
Honeypot
    used to detect attacks
File Integrity Checkers
    detects changes to key files by keeping hashes of them
Host-based IDS
    monitors logs from multiple sources
    detect misuse from trusted insiders or those who've infiltrated your network
    detection methods
Hybrid IDS
    combined Host-based and NNIDS
Network IDS (NIDS)
    monitors all traffic at segment where sensor installed
Network Node IDS (NNIDS)
    
Personal Firewall
    on individual systems
Network Intrusion Prevention System / Inlinde IDS
Host Intrusion Prevention System
Attack/DDOS Mitigation Tool
Intrusion Detection Working Group (IDWG)
Islanding
Load Balancing
Low and Slow
OS Fingerprinting (nmap)
    Passive
    Active
Out of Band (OOB)
    IDS management interface on separate network so can't be attacked
Promiscuous
    non-promiscuous - see what's addressed to it
    promiscuous - all traffic regardless of source/dest address
