001 - As the worm turns: the first internet works of 2005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aug 18, 2005

virus - needs user interaction (e.g. open attachment)
worm - self-propogates

For this to work.
Win2000 not XP, if unpatched and no firewall
NetBIOS ports 139 and 445 (some isps block those)
attached large corporate deployments
had a firewall, but not per machine
infected by laptop from outside, brought in and put on the network.

025 - How the Internet works, Part 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

packets
ipv4
ipv6 next
32bit to 128bit
32bit is 4,294,967,296. 
ipv6 3.4e38 addresses, absolutely massive!

NAT routers has meant running out ipv4 hasn't happened as quickly, been as big
    a problem

ipv6
    link-level security or IP-level security, endpoint-to-endpoint  encryption

source/dest ip address
protocol number: tcp/udp/icmp - one byte
ping used to check links when things go wrong
TTL - time to live
    when reaches zero, sends icmp w/ expired to source
traceroute - packets w/ increasing ttl
ip addressing is heirarchical
    so can look at start of address, and send it in that direction.

protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), share w/ neighbours the IPs that
    they know

classes of network
    class A, 8bits location, 24bits location w/in network
        e.g. ISP, 16million machines
    class B, 16bits location, 16bits w/in network
    class C, 24/8, 250 machines

can route around routers when they go down

045 - The 'Hosts' File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
June 22, 2006

every  system w/ tcp/ip has it
1st dns lookup happens here 

win: /windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
c:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc
matches ip to domain names
e.g.
127.0.0.1 localhost
can include other file, including remotely so can have just one version

block stuff you don't want to go to.
e.g.
127.0.0.1 doubleclick.net

some hosts files maintained publically online to filter out "bad" sites

e.g. go nowhere
0.0.0.0 bad.com
0 bad.com

mydoom virus modified hosts file so couldn't access antivirus sites


047 - Internet Weaponry (DoS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
9:50 - 10:34 (44mins) vs 62mins realtime.

July 6, 2006

Denial of Service (Dos) - swamp machine with internet packets,
    excess gets dropped from buffer overflow.
    Valid traffice can't get through
    it's a bottleneck

DDos (distributes Dos) - thousands of machines sending traffic to one point.
    more incoming bandwith than can handle.

These are flood attacks, other DoS attacks exist.
e.g. ping of death on windows, ping packet with same dest/source IP,
machine got into a 100%cpu loop

SYN flood -
    SYN is 1st TCP packet, to initiate a connection (synchronise)
    receives back a SYN/ACK
    final response in 3-way handshake
    receiving SYN allocates resources, earlier OSes could get attacked this way

analogy like a magnifying glass on your hand.
    OK to have spread out, problem is concentrated in one spot.

slashdot/digg effect similar, but non-malicious

1999 - 15yo Mafiaboy brought down yahoo and dell, ebay, amazon, cnn
estimated $1.7 billion damage.
Served 8 months in youth detention

IRC - blasting people off the net.
    because a relay of servers, taking one down splits network, when rejoin
    can kill the other user off the network.
    bots.

    botnet - bot network.
    initially to blast people off irc.

Steve has heard of attacks as large as 9 gigabits
botnets as large as 100,000

extortion - say pay us $x or we'll take you offline and it will cost much more

Best defence is to throw bandwith at it.

DNS, ping attack with ICMP for an hour against main dns servers.
    took down 9 of 13

backscatter - attacked by random generated ip address with SYN packets.
    san diego guys with large unused IP address space could see
    when people were getting attacked, because responses to theses SYNs
    were going to their IPs.

raw sockets were in XP until SP2, because attack was used against Microsoft


050 - Virtual Machine History & Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
9:02 - 9:36, 34 mins, real-time 52 mins

Jul 27, 2006

began in 1960 w/ IBM and VM/360

emulation is one type, e.g. intel mac's emulating powerpc for old programs

vm languages (e.g. java), perl6 on parrot vm

in interpreted environment, not running on hardware directly, but one level
removed.
creates sandbox so code can't do anything dangerous
more work to do, performance penalty when in software

intel chips beginning w/ 8286
    introduced protected mode (interprocess isolation) protects apps from one
    another.

intel added supervisory code, that could get notified under certain conditions
    notified when read/write to I/O devices
    notified when read/write to memory
    interception hardware protects individual i/o addressed, etc.


hardware assisted virtualization

053 - VMware (virtualization part 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aug 17, 2006

VMWare - files are essentially hard-drive, os and docs.
    Could take from windows vmware, and run on linux vmware.

    option to not save across sessions, i.e. starts fresh each time

    appliances - pre-created virtual machines
    player is free, workstation isn't

057 - Virtual PC versus VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sept 14, 2006

Patch Tuesday, 2nd tues of month, microsoft releases patches

VMware.
Virtual PC - Microsoft's offering, they bought it from Connectix
    doesn't support usb
    doesn't officially support other OSes

065 - Why is Security so Difficult?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nov 9, 2006

zero-day exploit, problem already occuring when discovered.
    exploited before developer is aware of it

security is hard because to be secure, you must have no insecurity,
    but all software has bugs, so this is impossible.
