* Eco Systems and Development Journey

    * Application Planning
    * Platform/lib selection
    * develop and test
    * deployment
    * monetize
    * analytics, support, update

* Smartphone - Hardware Overview
    * Locate
    gps - few metres
    cell grid triangulate - 100metres
    ip network - suburb/city
    * Touch
    resistive - cheaper, hard press
    capacative - much better
    * CPU/GPU
    dual cores coming in next gen.
    * Networking
    wifi 30Mbps
    gprs 48kbps
    3g 5-7Mbps
    bluetooth 3Mbps, nextgen 24Mbs
    1Mbps = 10sec to download 1MB file (megabit/byte)
    * Battery
    1500 mAh - screen is biggest consumer
    with gps - 20-25% on gps
    no gps
    50% display
    25% cell grid
    20% wifi
    5% idle
    * Memory
    flash ~10MB/s
    SD ~4-6 MB/s
    ram 256-512Mb, gpu shares ram
    
    * Screen
    different resolutions
    Xtra High 640x960 @ 320dpi
    High density 480x800 @ 240dpi
    medium 320x480 @ 160dpi
    low 240x400 @ 120dpi
    approx 2" across


* Hardware Constraints (Dev. perspective)
    mainly medium density screens, 320x480 @ 160dpi
    next gen ~320dpi (apple's retina display)

    constraints:
    usage length: mins/hrs
    sensor use
    network unreliable, erratic speed
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !!!!!!phone can ring at anytime!!!!!
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        put in background, try to come back, not guaranteed
    variable screen, processor, etc.
    only use a few MB memory
    MB in size on disk
    store data efficiently
    work with range of memory, cpu, etc. capabilities

    android's Droid Font, was worked on for many months/years

    What to do when phone rings?
    Would you download 30MB (e.g newspaper) over gprs, take hours?
    Would you wait a few mins for gps to locate you when using weather app.
    Sensors are normally powered down at standby, takes time to come backup.


* Mobile Operating Systems
    OS is resource manager
    life cycle of app tightly controlled by OS
    resource hogs will get killed by OS
    OS trickles out memory, aggressively deallocates.
        If view/image is not in foreground/running, will be destroyed
    Android lifecycle (can recover from kills/phone rings, etc)
        onPause(), onCreate(), etc

    And vs iOS
    iOS memory management better for iOS4 vs And2.3
    iOS will:
        terminate apps to reclaim memory
        send app to background on phone ring
        flush caches to free resources (e.g. images)
    App States:
        not running
        running (foreground/background)
            active
            in-active (waiting for IO)
        suspended (background)
            process state info is saved, but RAM used is normally purged.
    
    !!! Be paranoid about saving state all the time !!!

    FS
    wear levelling
    write = erase then write
    read is faster than write
    read ~6MB/s, write ~3MB/s
    IO critical for games

    Think about on disk size of app, and time for loading this into memory!

    !!!!!!!
    ASSUME
    !!!!!!!
    phone will ring
        be paranoid about state saving regulary
    resources will be allocated reluctantly
    erratic network connectivity
    slow read/write from flash card
    use RAM carefully
    minimise sensor use
    inform user if operation takes over 3secs
    keep core usecase as short as possible


* Convention Over Configuration
    reduce decisions developers need to make
    e.g. all images go in particular images directory,
        framework will reference these and provide code to load these.
    Android uses COC, but can ignore convention and do your own way.

    src/
    gen/
    res/
        drawable/
        layout/
        values/

    *DEMO* HelloWorld

Conclude
    Understand hardware and sensors
    constraints are real, must work with them
    Be paranoid about storing state.
    Convention Over Configuration
        makes your life easier.
