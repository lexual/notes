* Programs and Operating Systems.

Frameworks on top of API

* What is Android (for a programmer)?

c/c++ with ndk or java with sdk
dalvik
    virtual machine
    register based architecture (not stack based like jvm)
        quicker load and execution, larger program size

* Android - Device and Interaction Overview

iOS only 1 button.
android has 3 buttons: menu, back, home. can be soft-key in gingerbread

* Development Tools

iOS has xcode and sdk
android has ant as build system, can use eclipse
visual UI builder OK, not as good as Apple's
Android has emulator, Apple has simulator. Emulator is *slow*
need real phone to test on

* Configuring the IDE for Android Development

* Using the Logger

debug output
Log.d("TAG", "I am here!"); // debug
Log.v("TAG", "I am here!"); // verbose
i for information, also warning, error, fatal, silent

iOS has NSLog
remove when going into production
iOS #define them
Android - configure this via ProGuard
ProGuard - code optimisation/obfuscation tool

* Building a Simple App

Each screen is an Activity, made up of views (text, imageview, etc)

Layouts
    Linear - horiz or vertical
    Absolute
    Table
    Relative
    Frame - only show one at a time
    Scroll View
Can nest layouts (view groups)

layout as xml

view
    match_parent, fill_parent, wrap_content
    gravity - to position
    weight

android:text="@string/oz"
android:id="@+id/imageView1"
android:src="@drawable/australia"

values/strings.xml for strings
res/drawable-* for images

references generated in R.java ( as ints)

onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // called on startup
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
}

manifest defines which activity is created first
    define icon here too, app name, label

res/drawable-hdpi 240dpi
res/drawable-mdpi 160dpi
res/drawable-ldpi 120dpi
icon in each is advised

will scale if not provided

* Building an Interactive App

e.g. demo, celsius to fahrenheit

android:gravity="center_vertical|right"
