0 - Preface
=============

Done.

1 - How did we get here?
==========================

managing multiple version of information.

tracks changes
easier to collaborate on same code
can recover from mistakes

peer-to-peer

distributed advantages:
* faster, no central server to talk too.
* each repo is a backup
* can be used without a network
* easier to fork, but easier to merge too

convert extension for switch from other vcs's

2 - A tour of Mercurial: the basics
===================================

hg help <cmd>
e.g. hg help init
-v/--verbose for even more info

hg clone <x>
# makes a copy

.hg
# contains metadata on repo
# it's the repo, the files are the working directory

hg log
# see history

revision number: for that repo, handy notation.
hex string, permanent, unchanging identifier.

-r x
# see specific revision.
-r 2:4
# range of revisions.

hg log -v
# more info, which files, more of the commit message.
-p
# see diff

user for changeset comes from:
* -u option
* HGUSER env variable
* .hgrc's username entry
* EMAIL env variable
* username and hostname
.hgrc is recommended

cat .hgrc

[ui]
username = Lex Hider <lex.hider@gmail.com>
###

hg tip
# shows last commit.

hg pull -u
# pull then update

hg parents
# where are we now? what revision is working directory at.

.hg/hrc
has default location

hg init myproject
# makes myproject dir and myproject/.hg


3 - A Tour of mercurial: merging work
======================================

head - a change with no children

hg heads
# view heads

hg merge
# merges

hg parents
# after a merge, this has 2 commits listed.

uses external programs to merge conflicting changes
HMERGE env variable can set this.

kdiff3 is what author uses.
3 panes, left=base, middle=our's, right=their's
below is current result of merge.
red=unresolved conflict, replace with ours or theirs

merge
# unix command for merging.
leaves markers for merges.
<<<<< /tmp/a
hello steve
==========
hello dave
>>>>>> /tmp/b

hg resolve
# retry merge.

hg resolve -m foo.txt
# run this after manually editing merged file.
-m/--mark marks as resolved.

fetch extension
# does pull, update, merge, commit

.hgrc
[extensions]
fetch =
# empty rhs of equals, because part of standard extensions.

hg rename
hg mv # same thing
