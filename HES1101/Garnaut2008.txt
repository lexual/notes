In preparation for Copenhagen, Australia should support the objective of reaching international agreement around an objective of holding concentrations to 450 ppm CO2-e—inevitably with overshooting. It should express its willingness to reduce its own entitlements to emissions from 2000 levels by 25 per cent by 2020 and by 90 per cent by 2050 in the context of an international agreement, so long as the components of that agreement add up to the concentrations objective

While maintaining its support for the 450 objective, the Commonwealth Government should make it clear that it is prepared to play its full proportionate part in an effective international agreement to hold greenhouse gas concentrations to 550 ppm CO2-e. This would involve reducing emissions entitlements by 10 per cent by 2000 levels by 2020, and by 80 per cent by 2050

If there were no comprehensive global agreement at Copenhagen, Australia, in the context of an agreement among developed countries only, should commit to a reduction in emissions entitlements by 5 per cent from 2000 levels by 2020 (25 per cent per capita) or 13 per cent from Kyoto compliance in 2008–12. This would be Australia’s unconditional offer.

The Review takes as its starting point, on the balance of probabilities and not as a matter of belief, the majority opinion of the Australian and international scientific communities that human activities resulted in substantial global warming from the mid-20th century, and that continued growth in greenhouse gas concentrations caused by human-induced emissions would generate high risks of dangerous climate change.

Chapter 7 Australia’s emissions in a global context Australia’s per capita emissions are the highest in the OECD and among the highest in the world. Emissions from the energy sector would be the main component of an expected quadrupling of emissions by 2100 without mitigation. Australia’s energy sector emissions grew rapidly between 1990 and 2005. Total emissions growth was moderated, and kept more or less within our Kyoto Protocol target, by a one-off reduction in land clearing. Relative to other OECD countries, Australia’s high emissions are mainly the result of the high emissions intensity of energy use, rather than the high energy intensity of the economy or exceptionally high per capita income. Transport emissions are not dissimilar to those of other developed countries. Australia’s per capita agricultural emissions are among the highest in the world, especially because of the large numbers of sheep and cattle. The high emissions intensity of energy use in Australia is mainly the result of our reliance on coal for electricity. The difference between Australia and other countries is a recent phenomenon: the average emissions intensity of primary energy supply for Australia and the OECD was similar in 1971

An initial agreement on a global emissions path towards stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases at 550 CO2-e is feasible. 450 CO2-e is a desirable next step. Agreement on, and the beginnings of implementation of, such an agreement, would build confidence for the achievement of more ambitious stabilisation objectives

A global agreement on minimum commitments to investment in low-emissions new technologies is required to ensure an adequate level of funding of research, development and commercialisation. Australia’s commitment to support of research, development and commercialisation of low-emissions technology would be about $2.8 billion

The modelling of the 550 mitigation case shows mitigation cutting the growth rate over the next half century, and lifting it somewhat in the last decades of the century. GNP is higher with 550 mitigation than without by the end of the century. The loss of present value of median climate change GNP through the century will be outweighed by Type 3 (insurance value) and Type 4 (non-market values) benefits this century, and much larger benefits of all kinds in later years. Mitigation for 450 costs almost a percentage point more than 550 mitigation of the present value of GNP through the 21st century. The stronger mitigation is justified by Type 3 (insurance value) and Type 4 (non-market values) benefits in the 21st century and much larger benefits beyond. In this context, the costs of action are less than the costs of inaction

Australia should indicate at an early date its preparedness to play its full, proportionate part in an effective global agreement that ‘adds up’ to either a 450 or a 550 emissions concentrations scenario, or to a corresponding point between. Australia’s full part for 2020 in a 450 scenario would be a reduction of 25 per cent in emissions entitlements from 2000 levels, or one-third from Kyoto compliance levels over 2008–12, or 40 per cent per capita from 2000 levels. For 2050, reductions would be 90 per cent from 2000 levels (95 per cent per capita). xxxixThe Garnaut Climate Change Review Australia’s full part for 2020 in a 550 scenario would be a reduction in entitlements of 10 per cent from 2000 levels, or 17 per cent from Kyoto compliance levels over 2008–12, or 30 per cent per capita from 2000. For 2050, reductions would be 80 per cent from 2000 levels or 90 per cent per capita. If there is no comprehensive global agreement at Copenhagen in 2009, Australia, in the context of an agreement among developed countries only, should commit to reduce its emissions by 5 per cent (25 per cent per capita) from 2000 levels by 2020, or 13 per cent from the Kyoto compliance 2008–12 period

Any effort prior to an effective, comprehensive global agreement should be short, transitional and directed at achievement of a global agreement. A well-designed emissions trading scheme has important advantages over other forms of policy intervention. However, a carbon tax would be better than a heavily compromised emissions trading scheme

Chapter 15 Adaptation and mitigation measures for Australia Every Australian will have to adapt to climate change within a few decades. Households and businesses will take the primary responsibility for the maintenance of their livelihoods and the things that they value. Information about climate change and its likely impacts is the first requirement of good adaptation and mitigation policies. This requires strengthening of the climate-related research effort in Australia. The Australian Climate Change Science Program should be provided with the financial resources to succeed as a world-class contributor to the global climate science effort from the southern hemisphere. A new Australian climate change policy research institute should be established to raise the quality of policy-related research. Flexible markets using the best available information are the second essential component for successful adaptation and mitigation policies. It will be important to strengthen markets for insurance, water and food. Government regulatory intervention and provision of services will be required in relation to emergency management services and preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.

Low-income households spend much higher proportions of their incomes than other households on emissions-intensive products. The effects of the emissions trading scheme will fall heavily on low-income households, so the credibility, stability and efficiency of the scheme require the correction of these regressive effects by other measures. At least half the proceeds from the sale of all permits could be allocated to households, focusing on the bottom half of the income distribution. The bulk could be passed through the tax and social security systems, with energy efficiency commitments to low-income households in the early years

Australian material living standards are likely to grow strongly through the 21st century, with or without mitigation, and whether 450 or 550 ppm is the mitigation goal. Botched domestic and international mitigation policies are a risk. Substantial decarbonisation by 2050 to meet either the 450 or 550 obligation is feasible. It will go fastest in the electricity sector, then transport, with agriculture being difficult unless, as is possible, there are transformative developments in biosequestration

The era of modern economic growth has been intimately linked to rapid expansion in the use of fossil fuels. This is returning to the atmosphere a part of the carbon that was sequestered naturally over billions of years, through a process that created the conditions necessary for the emergence of human life on earth. While the share of carbon returned to the atmosphere is small relative to the stock, it is large enough to throw the equilibrium of heat trapping in the atmosphere out of balance

Compared to nitrogen and oxygen, which together comprise 99 per cent of the volume of the atmosphere, greenhouse gases occur only at trace levels, making up just 0.1 per cent of the atmosphere by volume (IPCC 2001a). Despite this, their presence means that the earth has an average global surface temperature of about 14ºC—about 33ºC warmer than if there were no greenhouse gases at all (IPCC 2007a: 946)

In the last 600 000 years the f luctuations show a periodicity of around 100 000 years (Ruddiman 2008). The periods when polar ice caps were greatly expanded, which resulted in ice sheets covering large parts of the northern continents, are known as glacial periods or ice ages. Those without extended polar ice caps are known as interglacials. The last glacial maximum occurred 21 000 years ago. For the last 10 000 years, the earth has been in an interglacial period (IPCC 2007a: 447)

The anthropogenically driven rise in carbon dioxide since the beginning of the industrial revolution (around 100 ppm) is about double the normal ‘operating range’ of carbon dioxide during glacial–interglacial cycling 25The Garnaut Climate Change Review (180–280 ppm) (Steffen et al. 2004). Trends in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide for the last 250 years are shown in Figure 2.1—it is not just the magnitude of the post-industrial increase in greenhouse gas concentrations that is unusual, but also the rate at which it has occurred

Carbon dioxide molecules absorb heat in a particular range of wavelengths, and as concentrations increase the additional heat of those wavelengths gets absorbed. If concentrations keep growing, carbon dioxide added later will cause proportionately less warming than carbon dioxide added now. The same amount of warming will occur from a doubling from 280 ppm (pre-industrial levels) to 560 ppm as from another doubling from 560 ppm to 1120 ppm

A measure commonly used in the literature and policy discussions is the concept of carbon dioxide equivalent of a gas concentration, measured in parts per million. This is a different but related measure to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions calculated using the global warming potential index. The former is the concentration of carbon dioxide that would cause the same amount of radiative 37The Garnaut Climate Change Review forcing as a particular concentration of a greenhouse gas. This term is often used in discussions of global stabilisation or concentration targets. The total radiative forcing of the long-lived greenhouse gases is 2.63 (± 0.26). In terms of carbon dioxide equivalence, this equates to a concentration of around 455 ppm CO2-e (range: 433–477 ppm CO2-e) (IPCC 2007b: 102). However, the warming that would result from this is offset by the cooling effects of aerosols and land-use changes, which reduce the concentration to a range of 311 to 435 ppm CO2-e, with a central estimate of about 375 ppm CO2-e (IPCC 2007b: 102)

of water vapour to increased temperatures, changes in cloud formation, and the implications of the melting of ice and snow for the amount of heat absorbed by the surface. Climate sensitivity relates to the equilibrium temperature reached when all elements of the climate system have responded to induced changes. Due to the long timescale of response, this may not occur for thousands of years. The IPCC estimates that it is likely (that is, a greater than 66 per cent chance) that a doubling of carbon dioxide will lead to a long-term temperature increase of between 2°C and 4.5°C (IPCC 2007a: 12). It is considered unlikely that climate sensitivity will be less than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be excluded, but these higher outcomes are less well supported (IPCC 2007a: 799). The best estimate of the IPCC is about 3°C (IPCC 2007a: 12)

The Review’s terms of reference required it to analyse two specific stabilisation goals: one at which greenhouse gases are stabilised at 550 ppm CO2-e and one at which they are stabilised at 450 ppm CO2-e. A stabilisation target of 450 ppm 42unDeRSTAnDIng ClImATe SCIenCe 2 CO2-e gives about a 50 per cent chance of limiting the global mean temperature increase to 2°C above pre-industrial levels (meinshausen 2006), a goal endorsed by the european union (Council of the european union 2007) among others. Stabilisation at 500 ppm or 550 ppm CO2-e would be less costly than a more ambitious target, but is associated with higher risks of dangerous climate change. Based on a best-estimate climate sensitivity of 3oC, stabilisation at 550 ppm CO2-e is likely to lead to an equilibrium global mean temperature increase of 3oC above pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2007b; meinshausen 2006)

Increasing attention is being paid in the environmental and scientific communities to low stabilisation scenarios. In particular, a number of organisations in Australia have suggested that the Review should focus as well on a 400 ppm objective. They argue that the risks of immense damage to the Australian environment, including the great Barrier Reef and Kakadu national Park, are unacceptably high at 450 ppm. Some scientists have also expressed the view that stabilisation at 450 ppm is too high (Hansen et al. 2008). For any such scenarios to be feasible, there would need to be a considerable period of overshooting

The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) estimates that in 2004 greenhouse gas emissions from human activity were about 50 Gt CO2-e. Almost 60 per cent of this total was emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and other carbon dioxide-emitting industrial processes (such as cement production and natural gas flaring). Other greenhouse gas emissions are measured less accurately. The IPCC (2007) reports that carbon dioxide emissions from land-use change and forestry make up 17 per cent of total emissions. Slightly less than one-quarter of emissions are other gases (which are converted to CO2-e using their global warming potential—see Chapter 2). Methane is responsible for 14 per cent of the total; nitrous oxide for 7 per cent; and a range of industrial gases for the remaining 1 per cent.

The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the countries at the centre of global economic activity. The largest emitters are China, the United States and the European Union, which between them are responsible for more than 40 per cent of global emissions. The 20 largest emitters (including emissions from land-use change and forestry) are responsible for more than 80 per cent of global emissions. (See Figure 3.1.)

For coal, the same trends are evident in both developed and developing regions, though in much more dramatic terms in the latter. Between 2000 and 2005, coal use increased in developing countries on average by 9.5 per cent annually, and by 11.7 per cent in China.4 In 2005, 61 per cent of the world’s coal was consumed in developing countries, up from 51 per cent just five years earlier. In 2005, coal provided 63 per cent of China’s energy, 39 per cent of India’s, and only 17 per cent of the rest of the world’s (IEA 2007b)

To throw light on this question, the Review sought assistance from two econometricians from the Australian National University. Trevor Breusch and Farshid Vahid have specific expertise in the statistical analysis of time series—a specialty that is well developed in econometrics. They were asked two questions: •Is there a warming trend in global temperature data in the past century? •Is there any indication that there is a break in any trend present in the late 1990s, or at any other point? They concluded: It is difficult to be certain about trends when there is so much variation in the data and very high correlation from year to year. We investigate the question using statistical time series methods. Our analysis shows that the upward movement over the last 130–160 years is persistent and not explained by the high correlation, so it is best described as a trend. The warming trend becomes steeper after the mid-1970s, but there is no significant evidence for a break in trend in the late 1990s.Viewed from the perspective of 30 or 50 years ago, the temperatures recorded in most of the last decade lie above the confidence band produced by any model that does not allow for a warming trend (Breusch & Vahid 2008)

Ocean acidity has increased globally as a result of uptake of carbon dioxide, with the largest increase in the higher latitudes where the water is cooler (IPCC 2007a: 405). The oceans are now more acidic than at any time in the last 420 000 years (Hoegh-guldberg et al. 2007)

About 75 per cent of the fresh water on Earth is stored in ice caps, ice sheets, glaciers and frozen ground, collectively known as the cryosphere. At a regional scale, variations in snowfall, snowmelt and glaciers play a crucial role in the availability of fresh water.

The three emissions cases Figure 4.4 shows the concentration pathways for the three emissions cases considered by the Review: •No-mitigation case—A global emissions case in which there is no action to mitigate climate change—the garnaut–Treasury reference case—was developed as part of the Review. This emissions case recognises recent high trends in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Emissions continue to increase throughout the 21st century, leading to an accelerating rate of increase in atmospheric concentrations. By the end of the century, the concentration of long-lived greenhouse gases is 1565 ppm CO2-e, and carbon dioxide concentrations are over 1000 ppm—more than 3.5 times higher than pre-industrial concentrations. •550 mitigation case—Emissions peak and decline steadily, so that atmospheric concentrations stop rising in 2060 and stabilise at around 550 ppm CO2-e— one-third of the level reached under the no-mitigation case. •450 mitigation case—Emissions are reduced immediately and decline more sharply than in the 550 case. Atmospheric concentrations overshoot to 530 ppm CO2-e in mid-century and decline towards stabilisation at 450 ppm CO2-e early in the 22nd century.

Sea-level rise will come from two main sources—thermal expansion and the melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers. The greater the temperature increase, the greater the sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the faster the loss of glacial mass (IPCC 2007a: 830). Current IPCC estimates predict that thermal expansion of the oceans will contribute 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the projected rise to 2100

Ongoing melt of the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets If a sufficiently warm climate were sustained, the greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets would be largely eliminated over a long period. If the greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets were to melt completely, they would add an estimated 7 m and 6 m to global sea level respectively (IPCC 2007a: 752; Oppenheimer & Alley 2005). Current models suggest that once a certain temperature is exceeded, major reduction of the greenland ice sheet would be irreversible. Even if temperatures were to fall later, the climate of an ice-free greenland might be too warm for the accumulation of ice (IPCC 2007a: 752, 776). Sufficient global temperature rise to initiate ongoing melt of the greenland ice sheet lies in the range of 1.2–3.9ºC relative to 1990 (IPCC 2007a: 752). A simple reading of the scientific literature suggests a high probability that, under business as usual, the point of irreversible commitment to the melting of the greenland ice sheet will be reached during this century.

Climate records show that at the end of the last interglacial, when the northern hemisphere ice sheets disintegrated, sea-level rise peaked at a rate of 4 m per century. This indicates that substantially higher rates of sea-level rise than those predicted by the IPCC have occurred historically (Church et al. 2008)
