1992 Climate Convention (Earth Summit)
"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a 
level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system ... within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt
naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened
and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner."

kyoto - 1997 11 december it was adopted.
average legally binding reductions of emissions of 5.2% belopw 1990 levels 
    below 2008 & 2012, US target of 7%.
2005, feb 11 came into effect, US never ratified it.
Australia never ratified until 2008, despite generous 8% increase given.
Canada - decided not to fulful obligations, 30% increase instead.
developing countries don't need to cut

3 flexibility mechanisms, if fail to meet target
    * CDM - Clean Development Mechanism
        developing countries can produce CER (certified emission reductions)
    * JI - Joint Implementation
        like CDM but between Annex-1 countries, producing ERU
        (emission reduction units)
    * ET - Emissions Trading
        can sell if undershoot target (mainly soviet)

p41
shipping and aviation omitted
shipping 1.2 Gt/yr, may rise by 75% by 2020 as trade increases
aviation - 2 to 3 times as potent
    700Mt/yr, 1.6% of global total.

p42
estimated 18% of global co2, from forest clearing

p43 
'honour' system
no real sactions for failing to meet cuts, face cuts in future allocations
    meaningless since these are negotiable
