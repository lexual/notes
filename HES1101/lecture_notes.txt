** A believers presentation

IPCC - intergovernmental panel on climate change
    Working Group 1 - The Physical Science Basis
    800 contributing authors
    450 lead authors
    2,500 reviewers
solar radiates on earth
    * some reflected
    * half absorbed by Earth surface
    * infrared radiation emitted from Earth's surface
        * some of this is absorbed & re-emitted by GHG and clouds
            * this warms Earth's surface and lower atmosphere
GHG
    Water vapour
    carbon dioxide
    methane
    tropospheric ozone
    nitrous oxide
    carbon monoxide
    - life wouldn't exist without greenhouse effect
GHG concentration has significantly increased since 1700s (pre-industrial)
    * hockey stick graph
aerosols can have cooling effect
land use changes can make cooler due to surface albedo changes.
linear fits to graph of temperature of past 150 years show warming trend,
    warming faster over more recent time periods.
numerical models, pretty good at matching to observed temperatures
volcano activities create temperature declines in short term
regional effects aren't uniformly distrubted

** A skeptical presentation

Titled: A Closer Look at Our Understanding of "Climate Change" by A. Skeptic
Tolstoi quote:
    "I know that most men, including those at ease
    with problems of the greatest complexity, can
    seldom accept even the simplest and most
    obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them
    to admit the falsity of conclusions which they
    delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they
    have proudly taught to others, and which they
    have woven, thread by thread, into the fabric of
    their lives."
    -- doesn't this apply to every field, and any claim about anything.
large list of climate change causal factors, not just GHG
    - albedo effects, aerosolds, urban heta islands, solar radiation variations, etc.
GHG
    -only 0.28% by concentration (co2 .117%)
    -- doesn't point out that climate forcing of each GHG is different 
        e.g. methane, much more forcing than co2 per unit.
graph of co2 concentration, axis from 0 to 100%, line basically at 0%
    similar graph from 0 to 1.5%
comparing last 150yrs of warming to warming that has occured over past millenias
showing warming trend of 1998 to 2008 with fairly horizontal line, trending 
    downards at end?
centuries graphs, deviations from mean
    * w/ scale of a degree, graph increasing
    * w/ scale of 40 degress, basically horizontal flat line
ice core data from antartica over 100,000s years, show large fluctuations
    -- but over what time period does this occur.
trend of cooling graph since 2003

conclusion
    * human's causing global warming: yes
        temperatures are no greater than in Earth's history
        no empirical evidence of the so-called problem


** Carbon cycle
carbon
    by mass
        .03% of Earth's crust
        .03% of atmosphere
        18.5% of human body
    organic chemistry - entrie branch devoted to chemisty of carbon-containing
        molecules
    hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, amino acids
    vital to life
    plants convert solar energy to chemical energy using water and atmospher co2
    photosynthesis
        6CO2 + 6H20 -> (light) -> C6H12O6 + 6O2
        plants and phytoplankton are main photosynthesisers
        aerobic respiration do opposite releasing c02 to get energy
    carbon is in atmosphere, minerals, dissolved in oceans, in dead/decaying material
    small amount in total in atmosphere, compared to amount in oceans and rocks
carboncycle
    many interactions
        burning fossil fuels
        soil respiration
        plant respiration
        photosynthesis
        volcanos
        litterfall
        rivers
        deforestation/land use change
        ocean uptake
        ocean loss
        burial to sediments in ocean.
    rouchly 1/4 of atmosphere's carbon cycles in/out each year
    natural processes that affect this exchange rate
        volcanic activity
        oceanic biota - biological pump
        ocean solubility
        plant growth (fertilisation)
    volcanic activity and atmosphereic co2 are correlate, but not major effect
    volcanic aerosols can make cooling
    volcanic co2 ~100 times less than human activity
    atmospheric c02 measurements, not really effected by volcanos
        e.g. last 50 years co2 graph, linear going up
    biological pump
        algae/plankton have rapid life cycles, dies and sink to ocean bottom
        strong geological evidence that has been responsible for controlling co2 
            levels in atmosphere
        some experts sugessted to stimulate biological pump (by iron dust) to 
            combat emissions
    ocean solubility
        co2 dissolves in ocean depending on ocean ph, atmospheric concentration,
            temp etc,
        amount of co2 dissolved in oceans increases at roughly 1/10 of increase
            in atmospheric co2
        combines with other ocean effects (thermal currents) to create solubility pump
            solubility increases with decreasing temp
    fertilisation
        more plant growth with more atmospheric co2
            also increased temp means more plant respiration (emit co2)
    carbon cycle in present day is not in equilibrium
        increasing in atmosphere at 3.3Gt/yr

** climate & natural cycles
Climate System
climate vs weather
    weather short term
    climate - average (over 10-30yrs) of weather conditions, variations, extremes
        primarily atmospheric, but other aspects.
        physical components
            atmosphere
                bulk air movement
                heat/light transmission
                temperature
                chemical composition
                role in water cycle
            land (lithosphere)
                land cover (vegation, ice)
                topography affect air movent and solar absorption
                seasonal changes
                water cycle
            oceans (hydrosphere)
                majority of Earth surface
                important thermal properties includg energy transport, water cycle
            cryosphere
                land and ocean based ice, strongly affected by temperature
        biological components
            biosphere (terristrial and marine)
                life has strong influence on physical environment
                    especially chemical processes (e.g. carbon cycle)
            biota - living organisms that occupy the biosphere
        physical and biological components constantly interacting exchanging
            energy and material
    water cycle
        the largest chemical transfer on earty
        70% Earth's surface is covered with Water
        1.4*10^9 km3 of water on Earth
        97.4% water is in oceans
            of the remaining most of that is ground water & ice caps and glaciers
                of remaining 0.14%
                    most in lakes and soil moisture
                    what's left is in atmosphere, rivers and biota
        evaporation -> vapour transfer -> precipitation -> return flow
        complex cycle
        factors
            evaporation and precipitation rates
            "residence times" in oceans, atmosphere, glaciers, etc.
            changes/interruptions to return flow routes
        import controls of these factors
            human consumption
            temperature
            land use changes
        human water consumption
            most through agriculture, then industry, then municipal 
            projected to increase
        temperature effects:
            evaporation rates (increase with warmer temperature)
            melting rates in cryosphere
            effects on vapour transport/cloud formation
            changing freshwater flow into oceans may alter currents
        land use
            e.g. deforestation
            higher evaporation rates in forested land
            changes in return flow
            surface effects on wind patterns can alter vapour transport and cloud formation
            changes in reflected/absorbed solar energy, causing local temperature changes
            can also alter "nutrient run-off" into oceans impacting biosphere
        global "stores" are huge compared to human needs
        fresh water part we depend on is delicately dependent on many factors
        due to be major issue w/out CC (population and industrialisation)
other important cycles to life
    nitrogen cycles
    sulphur, calcium, phosphorous
    carbon cycle ** !! ** -- import to this subject.


** detection and attribution (Mary Voice, Cumulus Consulting)
detect
    demonstrate that change is statistaclly unusual
    statistical problem (chance that this is a chance effect)
attribution
    establish cause and effect
    disprove the "null hypothesis - that observation can be explained by
        natural variability
detection
    5 steps
        look for evidence
        decide if relevant and high quality
        don't stop after first peice of evidence that fits
        test evidence in court
        develop techniques for improved detection and for false conclusions

QUOTE:
Climate Data and Networks
"No matter how fundamental the theory of hypothesis, observatios are the 
building blocks of science"
-- US National Academy of Sciences National Research Council (1999)

better techniques
    special-purpose networks for high quality CC detection (global and regional)
    GCOS - global climate observing system
        2 main components
            *GCOS Surface Network (GSN) - 989 stations globally
            *GUAN (GCOS Upper Air Network) - 150 stations
            gives better confidence to data studies
detectin in the real world
    careful, e.g. instrument shelter change, site location change
    * single time series for single variable
    * pattern recognition - fingerprints
    * look at multiple variables simultaneously, spatial plus temporal signals
correlation doesn't equal causation!!
modeling vs observations, compare
fingerprint - if GHG is warming, warmer nights and days
1st part of attribution - plausible link between signal and hypothesised cause
establish the *most likely cause*!
run models with and without anthropogenic forcings and match up
attribution never "certain", but can have confident attribution

** global energy
Energy & Temperature
energy - ability to do work, or effect a change.
solar main source of energy
all objects emit electromagnetic radiation
    amount and type determined by temp
    radiated power = cT^4
342W/m^2 on Earth
30% reflected back, .3 albedo
temperature would be -15 degC, actual is +15 degC
greenhouse effect
    not equally transparent to all wavelengths, high absorbing of long waves
    out of kilter, raise temp to new balace
    runaway
        positive feedback, increased temp, creased water vapour
        e.g. venus
radiative forcing - change in net flow of radiation W/m2 at tropopause
different times spent in atmosphere by different gases
GWP - long term effect - global warming potential
    relative co2 having a value of 1
    e.g. over 100 yrs
    methand 23
    no2 296, etc.

** human energy use
units - BTU british thermal unit
    quadrillion BTU
    MTOE - million tons of oil equiv
power - rate energy is produced
    watt - joule per second
    1 kwhr = 3.6 MJ
energy is conserved
always inefficiencies (losses) when energy changes form
increasng energy demand very high in recent years
burning coal


** intro to modelling
overview
    distinction between scientific/empirical
    between static/dynamic and steady/unsteady systems
    issues of verification and validation
    can we trust predictions of models?
model - tool to answer questions about system w/out doing experiment
mental/physical/mathematical models
models
    inform experiments
    develop theoretical debate
    predictive tools
    models for control/design of systems
white/grey/black box
    white
        fully scentific
        fundamental principles
        no "ad hoc" constants/adjustments
        e.g. projectile in vacuum
        computationally intensive
        good for "understanding" 
        difficult to apply to complex geometry and inter-coupled phenomena
    grey
        based on fundamental principles but "adjusted"
        empirical constants and "ad hoc" equations added
        semi-empirical
        e.g. anything to do w/ heat, mass, momentum transfer (climate models)
        often accurate/reliable
        can have loss of important detail
        dangerous to apply to outside range of original data
        pragmatic approach
    black
        relationship between inputs and outputs
        multi-variate statistics, neural networks and fuzzy logic
        fully-empirical
        e.g. complex industrial systems - control of blast furnace
        can provide good predictions
        lead to scientific insights
        dangerous to apply to outside range of original data
static models
    unchanging result w/ a key variable (normally time)
    end point/equilibrium state
    often starting point for dynamic system analysis
steady state
    rate in = rate out
unsteady
    rate in = accumulation + rate out
    maths are much harder, often leading to numerical/grey box analysis
verification
    are solutions independent of computer program?
    independent of numerical details
    appropriate grid size for calculation?
    repeatability of calculations
validation
    how close is prediction to reality
    how to compare this
    compare future prediction to reality
    is it valid to compare models w/ models
    is creator of model the right person to assess the model?
semi-empirical relationships
validation is difficult
    



** models 1
Models of physics/chemistry of climate system
predicting
    extrapolate from current trends
    analysis of cycles - also extrapolate
    statistical forecasting
        describe mean, standard deviations, etc
    dynamical forecasating - equations of motion of fluid, etc.
climate is complex
    extrapolation and cycles are inadequate!
GCM - General Circulation Model 
    dynamical forecasting
    computer model
    global 4D (3D + time) includes atmosphere, oceans, land
    simulates general circulation of atmosphere
    used for weather and climate simulation
    
    perfect weather forecast
        know pressure/temp/wind/etc at each point at start of forecast
    instead, capture basic features of atmospheric flow by predicting air parcels
    treat as discrete parcels/grids, 3d mesh
    smaller parcels mean better
    represent continuous flowing fluids of atmosphere and ocean.
can't predict weather, how predict climate?!?
weather - initial value problem
climate - boundary value problem
    can't forecast position of fronts, can forecast season character, etc.
    less dependent on initial state

    beaker analogy
        stirrer, can only predict for short amount of time
    heater
        can predict evolution of warmth over time
valid?
    can it reproduce current climate accurately
    does it model the physical processes well enough, that a changed predicition
        is possible by the model
can simulate observed 20th C changes
    need all forcings to match models to data, not just natural forcings
sources of uncertainty
    not containing all details
    party chaotic
    external/unpredicatble events, e.g. volcanoes
climate models based upon fundamental laws of physics
climate forecast - interested in statistical properties (e.g. mean temp)
    rather than specific, e.g. 28 Jan 2012


** models 2
Forecasting for the future
CC assessment process
    climate theory
    detect and attribute
    predict/estimate future GHG emissions
    run climate models for future climates
    assess impacts 
input: current levels and future forcing agents
emissions scenarios (how much GHG in future, over time)
SRES - Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
    all considered possible
    a1, a2, b1, b2
    "what if" studies
scenarios show up to 2-3 times 1990 levels by 2100 for co2
annual emissions -> concentrations
feed this data into models, test each SRES scenario separately
low scenario (1.8, 1.1-2.9)
high scenario (4.0, 2.4-6.4)
SLR - sea level rise
    not predicted w/in climate models
    extra calculation using model outputs
    extra water in ocean and thermal expansion
    roughly 20-50cm for century
    incursion (who goes under water?)

choose target temp/slr, and work backward to scenario that gives it (b1)
b1
    co2 peak no higher than 40% above present, decline by 2040s
    per capita no higher than 20-30% above current by 2040s
    total emissions to 1990 levels by 2060
        per capita to 60% of present levels

emissions already above b1 trajectory

results
    greater warming over land than sea
    less warming over high latidute southern oceans and Antarctica
    most warming at high northern latitues
    increased wnter rain and soil moisture at high lats
    increase mean rain in Asia summer monsoon region
diurnal range
    observed decrease in diurnal range
        blanketing at night, minT increase
    aerosols tend to reduce too
extreme events
    high summer max
    lower winter min
for next 2 decades
    .2degC per decade projected
    still see .1degC/decade if co2 kept constant
less snow cover
thaw of permafrost
sea ice shring
artic summer ice may disappear
    1.9 to 4.6degC to melt Greenland ice sheet
    would lead to 7m rise
    comparable to 125,000 yrs ago
    long time scale!! millenia
