September 2008, I presented the Review’s final report to the Australian Prime Minister. The report examined how Australia, as a single country, was likely to be affected by climate change and how it could best contribute to climate change mitigation, and begin to adapt. In November 2010, I was commissioned by the Australian Government to provide an update to the 2008 Review. In particular, I was asked to examine whether significant changes had occurred that would affect the key findings and recommendations reached in 2008

The year 2010 ranked with 2005 and 1998 as the warmest on record, with global average temperatures 0.53°C above the 1961–90 mean. For Australia, 2009 was the second-warmest year on record and the decade ending in 2010 has easily been Australia’s warmest since record keeping began

It so happens that answering questions of this kind comes with the professional kitbag of economists who work on statistical analysis of series of data that cover periods of time. For the 2008 Review, I asked two leading Australian econometricians who are specialists in this area, Trevor breusch and Fashid Vahid, to analyse the data on temperature. Their conclusion was clear. There is a statistically significant warming trend, and it did not end in 1998 or in any other year. I had the analysis repeated with three more years of data for this book, with the same conclusions

Under increased greenhouse gas scenarios, climate models predict that the lowest layer of the atmosphere (the troposphere) should warm, while the next layer up (the stratosphere) should cool. This has been confirmed by recent observation. If increased output from the sun were the cause, both layers could be expected to warm

For developing countries, targets are measured not in absolute reductions but in reductions in emissions intensity. The modified contraction and convergence framework described in the 2008 Review implied a targeted reduction in China’s emissions intensity of 35 per cent between 2005 and 2020 if global concentrations of carbon dioxide were to be limited to 450 ppm. At Copenhagen and Cancun, China pledged to reduce its carbon intensity by 40 to 45 per cent between 2005 and 2020

There are two basic approaches to achieving the required emissions reduction: a market-based approach, built around putting a price on carbon emissions; and a regulatory approach, or direct action. In the market-based approach, carbon can be priced in two ways. Fixedprice schemes, or carbon taxes, set the price and the market decides how much it will reduce the quantity of emissions. Floating price schemes set the quantity of emissions and permits to emit are issued up to that amount. The permits are tradeable between businesses and so the market sets the price. There are various hybrid approaches that combine fixed prices for a period with floating later on, and floating prices at some price levels with a price f loor or a price ceiling or both. In the alternative route, regulation or direct action, there are many ways that government can intervene to direct firms and households to go about their business and their lives. The Chinese Government’s direct action includes issuing instructions for factories with high emissions to close, subsidising consumers who buy low-emissions products like solar electricity panels and electric cars, and restricting new investment in industries judged to have undesirably high emissions. Chapter 5 explores these options and argues for a three-year fixed carbon price followed by a carbon trading scheme with a floating price

Chapter 7 examines this phenomenon and notes that in a political economy already dominated by vested interests, a transparent, market-based carbon price is far less likely to be unduly influenced by private interests than a regulatory approach which provides recurring opportunities for lobbying. A market-based approach will, for this among other reasons, cost Australians substantially less

Land-use changes, such as deforestation and conversion to crops, are the second-largest source of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities. In contrast to the 29 per cent increase in fossil fuel emissions between 2000 and 2008, land-use change emissions have been fairly steady and now account for less than 15 per cent of total emissions

However, such comparisons generally do not allow us to state categorically that such an event could only have occurred with climate change. We can say that the extreme conditions that were the backdrop to the Victorian bushfires or the 2011 Queensland cyclones and floods will be more likely to occur and will occur more often in a warmer world

Climate models indicate that as temperatures rise further, rainfall will increase close to the poles and in equatorial regions, and decrease in subtropical and some temperate regions. Climate change will also influence the seasonal and daily patterns of rainfall intensity. The risk of drought is expected to increase in the mid-latitudes (southern Australia). Increased flood risk is also expected as rainfall is concentrated into more intense events.1

Amalgamating the above projections of the individual drivers of businessas-usual emissions, we find that global emissions to 2030 rise at an average of 2.8 per cent per year. Developed countries contribute 30 per cent of global emissions in 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Developing countries contribute 70 per cent of global business-as-usual emissions at 2030, up from 50 per cent today. China’s and India’s share in global emissions would be 41 and 11 per cent respectively. The share of other developing countries would remain at 19 per cent of the global total. Total global emissions from fossil fuels are projected to double between 2005 and 2030 under business as usual

In the year to August 2010, gas generation supplied more than 11 per cent of eastern states’ electricity demand, while black coal supplied 56 per cent and brown coal 24 per cent. Renewables, including hydroelectric and wind, supplied the remaining 9 per cent. Australia releases annual projections of our emissions on the basis of current policies. The 2010 report shows that Australia is on track to meet its Kyoto Protocol target of limiting emissions to an average of 108 per cent of 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, with emissions projected to reach 106 per cent of 1990 levels (see Figure 2.3). However, the report forecasts strong growth in emissions in the absence of further policy action. Emissions are projected to increase by 24 per cent from 2000 levels by 2020. This represents a 4 per cent upward revision of the previous year’s projections, and is 4 per cent above expectations in 2007. Australia’s 2020 emissions target, as reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is an unconditional 5 per cent reduction relative to 2000, with conditional targets extending to a reduction of 25 per cent depending on the actions of others. The projected growth in emissions thus presents a substantial mitigation task in the decade ahead, and obviously higher still with higher levels of ambition.

The 2008 Review recommended, and the Australian Government and Opposition accepted, that it was in Australia’s national interest to seek a global emissions concentrations objective of 450 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is broadly equivalent to the objective of holding temperature increases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, which was agreed by the international community at the Cancun meeting. To hold concentrations at a level that would mean warming of no more than 2°C would require a major elevation of the importance of climate change in national priorities. From the perspective of 2011, for the world to hold emissions concentrations to 550 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent would be an achievement of international cooperation and innovation in national economic policy of large dimensions. To achieve 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent with only the degree of overshooting envisaged in the 2008 Review would be an achievement in international relations and national public policy of historic dimensions. The path to anything lower than 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent now has to involve overshooting. In this light, the most important development in scientific discussion of mitigation goals since 2008 is an increasing focus on a cumulative emissions budget.

To achieve reductions in atmospheric concentration and eventual stabilisation, emissions must fall below the natural level of removal from the atmosphere by the oceans and biosphere. As we have seen, the rate of removal can be affected by climate change itself, an outcome referred to as a ‘carbon–climate feedback’. Research suggests that the rate of uptake by ocean and land sinks decreases as higher temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations are reached. The major risk and uncertainty associated with overshooting is the level of climate change reversibility. Some models suggest that it may be possible to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases significantly over one or two centuries. Other models indicate that the rate of reduction in concentrations may be considerably slower, and there is also the chance that the climate may be pushed past a point of no return

The same continued potential for catch-up exists for greenhouse gas emissions. Seventy per cent of global emissions by 2030 would come from developing economies that are home to 80 per cent of the global population. Under business as usual, China’s annual emissions per person would reach those in the United States by 2030 (at around 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person from fossil fuel combustion only). Across the developing countries, however, emissions per person would still only amount to 38 per cent of those in the United States (or China), with obvious strong potential for further growth.

From its inception in 1990, the United Nations process that was crystallised in the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 divided developed from developing countries, and only the developed were bound by a specific emissions target. The Kyoto agreement set a goal for developed countries together to reduce emissions by 5 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period). The position that only developed countries should have emissions targets was thought to be appropriate for four reasons: the developed countries were responsible for most of the emissions already accumulated in the atmosphere; they were still responsible for most emissions; they could more easily afford the cost of adjustment to a low-carbon economy; and they were in a better position to develop and deploy new low-emissions technologies. The Howard government spoke for us in 1997 and concurred

The new regime carries on a number of elements of the old. It continues the definition of greenhouse gases and the way of calculating national emissions, and the processes for agreeing to change these methods over time. It carries forward agreements and discussions of the several mechanisms for assisting developing countries with reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change. It defines emissions reduction targets in terms of emissions within one’s own boundaries—a production rather than consumption basis for calculating national emissions. It allows countries to meet part of their emissions reductions requirements by purchasing entitlements from others who are overachieving on their own targets. Finally, it carries forward and in a sense fulfils several of the objectives of the Kyoto arrangements, most importantly through the objective of containing global warming to below 2°C. It also changes or abandons some features and aspirations of the Kyoto regime. It has secured commitments to emissions constraints that are far wider in their scope and quantitatively far more important than those made at Kyoto in 1997. However, these have been voluntarily offered by the country making the undertaking, and have not been agreed in a political negotiation. The process, which had been suggested by the Australian delegation as a way out of an impasse in Copenhagen, is described as ‘pledge and review’, and it is hoped that the review component will lead over time to some broad equivalence among the pledges being made. This has been described as a ‘bottom–up’ approach, which is contrasted with the ‘top–down’ approach at Kyoto. And it does not pretend that these are legally binding agreements; they are serious national and international political commitments but are not enforceable in courts of law. How important are the two main innovations in the Cancun form of international agreement: the unilateral nature of the emissions reduction commitments, and their voluntary—but legally unenforceable—nature? There would have been advantages in a comprehensive global agreement on emissions entitlements covering developing as well as major developed countries that ‘added up’ to the global temperature objective and to the emissions budget that was implicit in that objective. We would have arrived at a set of national commitments that would, if implemented, solve the problem. And we would have had a firm basis for international trade in entitlements, where countries that were having difficulty meeting their targets purchased permits from countries that were able to constrain emissions by more than was required by the agreement

What, then, are the advantages of binding commitments? They would provide support for global international trade in entitlements. Trade would reduce the costs of emissions reductions for the world as a whole and for each country. Trade would also establish a single price for entitlements in all countries that participated without limits in trade in credible emissions permits. The firm and verifiable nature of the commitments, with international trade in entitlements, would give rise to the single price—the price would be the same in a country with targets that required large absolute reductions in entitlements as in one in which entitlements were based on reductions in emissions intensity of output. The single price, in turn, would remove distortions in international trade in goods and services associated with variations in the costs of reducing emissions across countries. It would therefore remove any case for assistance to trade-exposed industries in any country, with potentially large and beneficial implications for the public finances and for the integrity of policy-making processes in all countries. These advantages were discussed at length in the 2008 Review. The advantages of a comprehensive and binding international agreement that adds up to the global emissions budget are as strong in 2011 as they were three years ago. Such an agreement remains the Holy Grail

It turns out that the difference between binding and non-binding agreements is not as wide in practice as this description suggests. The notionally binding commitments under the Kyoto Protocol turned out not to be legally enforceable in practice; and all countries at this stage are treating Cancun statements on emissions constraints as serious domestic and international political commitments. The US Government is treating its Cancun target as a serious objective of domestic policy and taking steps towards its fulfilment. China and India have made achievement of their emissions intensity targets central features of their five-year economic plans

The world has groped its way towards the conception of what a fair share is in the Cancun Agreements. Developed countries have pledged to reduce the absolute amount of emissions by specified percentages. Major developing countries have pledged percentage reductions in the emissions intensity of production, or percentage reductions below business as usual. These are not bad starting points. They need to be developed in a couple of ways. While both developed and developing countries must enter commitments to constrain emissions, a distinction can be drawn on the way those constraints are set. An international agreement can work with developed countries accepting targets for absolute reductions in emissions, and developing countries targets for reductions in emissions intensity. What is missing are rules for the transition of a country from developing to developed status. I suggested in the 2008 Review that the transition can take place when a developing country’s emissions per person reach the (falling) average level of developed countries. That still seems practical as well as ethical

The 2008 Review argued that a ‘modified contraction and convergence’ framework was the best approach to calibrating fair shares across countries. 3 What’s a fair share? | 43 This was based on the practical consideration that no basis for allocating entitlements to emissions would be broadly acceptable unless it allowed similar amounts of emissions to each person. It was not practical to move to equal entitlements per person overnight from the current position. The starting point on emissions per person ranges from Australia’s 27 tonnes per person a year, to and below India’s almost 2 tonnes (see Figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: World Bank’s chart of emissions per person in selected countries
==========
garnaut-review-2011-crop

Under contraction and convergence, the allocation for each country would move from its current level of emissions to equal entitlements per person in some later year. This is the convergence part. The contraction part is that total global emissions would fall from current levels to a much lower level at a specified date—a level low enough to meet the climate change objective. It was not practical for developing countries, which were growing quickly with rapidly increasing emissions, suddenly to converge towards a low level of entitlements per person. The ‘modification’ part of ‘modified contraction and convergence’ is to allow rapidly growing developing countries to operate within an emissions intensity target for the time being. When they reached 44 | The Garnaut Review 2011 average emissions per person of the developed countries, their emissions per person would converge on the low emissions per person towards which other countries were moving. The 2008 Review calculated a global emissions budget over time and allocated entitlements to draw on that budget within the modified contraction and convergence framework. Convergence would occur in 2050, by which time all countries would have entitlements per person below one-half of the current world average, or a bit below India’s current level. This was broadly consistent with stabilisation (with overshooting) of emissions concentrations at 450 parts per million. This was the framework that gave rise to the 2008 Review’s recommendation on targets for Australia and indicative targets for other countries. The rationale for this approach is ethical as well as practical. It is ethical in that it does not place additional new hurdles in the way of raising living standards for millions of the world’s poor at an early point in their countries’ economic development. While efficient approaches to reducing emissions can hold costs to manageable levels, it is equitable that a higher proportion of those costs be borne by richer countries. Two other considerations colour the ethical debate. There were two main criticisms of the 2008 Review’s modified contraction and convergence approach, from commentators in India and China in particular. First, some commentators thought it unfair that those countries which happened now to have some of the highest emissions per person—Australia, Canada and the United States among developed countries—should continue to occupy that position for a long time into the future. Second, some critics thought that account should be taken of the historical reality, that developed countries had been responsible for most of the accumulation of greenhouse gases that has brought the world to its current dangerous position. There may be an emerging understanding that historical responsibility is handled best by developed countries assisting mitigation and adaptation in low-income developing countries. It so happens that modified contraction and convergence gives similar results for Australia to percentage reductions from a base year. With contraction and convergence, Australia’s high starting level of emissions causes the rate of reduction in emissions entitlements to be higher than it would be with simple percentage reductions from a base year. Australia’s high population growth rate brings it down. Australians should recognise that the broad approaches to emerge from Cancun suit their national interests as well as any of the feasible alternatives. 3

Note that the targets for reducing emissions or emissions intensity relate to entitlements and not to emissions within a country’s borders. This means that neither a country nor a firm operating within it is disadvantaged by having its exports concentrated in emissions-intensive industries—as Australia has with gas and coal and China with manufacturing—so long as two conditions are met. All substantial countries must accept targets; the way in which the targets are set is not important to the point under discussion. And there must be international trade in entitlements. The trade causes the carbon cost to be embodied in the world market price for the product, which allows the country and firm to recoup the cost of buying entitlements. Deep trade among a set of countries which includes major sellers and buyers of entitlements is enough to secure these benefits; not all countries need to participate in trade

Some Australians argue that some of these countries—notably the two largest, China and the United States—have not adopted carbon pricing, and that Australia would be getting ahead of the world if it did so. yet the mainly regulatory measures being taken by those countries impose greater costs on business and on their communities’ standards of living than carbon pricing. This is clear from economic analysis. The Productivity Commission report on emissions pricing should provide empirical evidence on the costs of regulatory approaches to reducing emissions. While the higher costs of emissions reduction in other countries should not be counted as a contribution to the mitigation effort, neither should it count against them so long as they are meeting their commitments to constrain emissions

The pledged target ranges for the United States, the European Union and Japan all correspond to entitlements for a global agreement between 450 ppm and 550 ppm. The targets pledged by Canada and Russia, by contrast, are less 50 | The Garnaut Review 2011 ambitious than suggested for a 550 ppm global agreement. And, on average, developed countries’ pledged 2020 targets are somewhat less ambitious than are needed under a 550 ppm scenario. For developing countries, fair shares are measured not in absolute reductions but in reductions in emissions intensity (see Table 4.2). The modified contraction and convergence framework of 2008 implied a targeted reduction in China’s emissions intensity of 35 per cent from 2005 to 2020 if global concentrations of carbon dioxide were to be limited to 450 ppm. At Copenhagen and Cancun, China pledged to reduce its carbon intensity by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 to 2020. It thereby exceeded what was viewed as an adequate commitment even under an ambitious global agreement. India has pledged reductions in emissions intensity of 20 to 25 per cent on 2005 levels by 2020. Its proportional emissions intensity reduction for a 450 ppm outcome would have been 43 per cent. The Parikh report on low carbon growth strategies to the Indian Prime Minister in May 2011 commented that India could achieve emissions intensity reductions in the range 33 to 35 per cent with support from international financing and technological transfer.

A number of major developing countries have pledged reductions relative to a business-as-usual scenario (including Indonesia, brazil, Mexico, South Africa and the Republic of Korea). Analyses of plausible business-as-usual scenarios have shown that, if realistic baselines are applied, the Copenhagen pledges imply reductions in absolute emissions in these countries between 2005 and 2020. These, too, are as ambitious—or more ambitious—than were called for under the modified contraction and convergence framework developed and proposed in the 2008 Review. Overall, the modified contraction and convergence framework suggests that global commitments add up to somewhere near the level of reductions in emissions needed to limit greenhouse gas concentrations to 550 ppm. Within the same framework, developing countries are leading the effort in relation to their respective fair shares

The OECD’s International Energy Agency formed a more pessimistic assessment, suggesting that existing commitments were heading towards 650 ppm. Frank Jotzo suggests that the Cancun commitments of others would trigger movement to minus 15 per cent in Australia within the conditional target entered at Cancun. The differences between the Garnaut Review and International Energy Agency assessments derive from different approaches to what happens after 2020. The point of difference is whether rapidly growing developing countries accept the suggestion that they should commit to reducing absolute emissions within a straightforward contraction and convergence framework once their emissions per person have reached the (falling) average emissions per person of the developed countries

The Scandinavian countries were the world’s first movers on substantial climate change mitigation policy and they have stayed in front. They have been pricing carbon since 1991. This is one reason why Norway is not a carbon-intensive economy, despite being the only other developed country with endowments of fossil fuels that are in any way comparable to Australia’s. Norway’s emissions per person are 10.9 tonnes, and Australia’s 27.3 tonnes. For those who fret about the effect of a carbon price on some generalised notion of Australian ‘competitiveness’ and who believe that measures of such things have meaning, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have all been higher than Australia on the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index every year over the past decade. In several years they have occupied three of the top four places among 139 countries, and in all years three of the top ten. Australia’s ranking has ranged between 5th in 2001 and 16th in 2010, and has fallen as low as 19th. Australia has not ranked in the top ten since 2003. Norway, in particular, has played a leading role in providing support for mitigation in developing countries, including in Indonesia. The European Union established an emissions trading scheme in 2005 and has steadily tightened its parameters since then. The European Union’s conditional targets are relatively strong compared to those of other developed countries within the framework of modified contraction and convergence. Half the people in the developed world—half a billion people—are covered by the European Union’s emissions trading scheme

The Conservative-led coalition government under Prime Minister David Cameron came to power with commitments to extend the strong mitigation policies of the Labour government that it replaced. The government’s resolve was tested when the independent committee on climate change recommended the legislation of a target to reduce emissions by 60 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030. This is from levels that are already relatively low: in 2005, UK total emissions were 1.7 per cent of global emissions, compared to Australia’s portion of almost 1.5 per cent. The committee’s recommendations were debated at length in cabinet, and their acceptance was announced in May 2011.

The authorities have pursued multiple environmental, energy security and other objectives by closing many emissions-intensive plants, and constraining energy supply or raising the cost of energy to others. There has been a rapid reduction in the emissions intensity of coal-fired electricity generation. Environmentally damaging, unsafe and economically inefficient small coal-fired generators have been closed at the rate of one every ten days or so. They have been replaced by larger plants that are economically and environmentally much more efficient. China decommissioned smaller, environmentally and economically inefficient plants with combined generation capacity of 70 gigawatts—one and a half times the total Australian power generation capacity of the electricity market.

Specific fiscal interventions have restricted or raised the costs of inputs to the most emissions-intensive industries, including steel, aluminium and cement. Some of these industries have been denied the rebates for exports that are normal in value-added-tax regimes in China, Australia and elsewhere, amounting to a large discriminatory tax on these emissionsintensive, trade-exposed industries. Some provinces now impose a surcharge on power use equivalent to either $19 per tonne of carbon dioxide on electricity used in highly emissions-intensive plants or $57 per tonne of carbon dioxide on electricity used in excessively emissions-intensive plants in eight ‘high-polluting’ industries.

More than half of the population of the developed world lives in countries with emissions trading schemes. More than 30 countries have introduced, or are seriously considering introducing, market-based measures to help meet their emissions reduction targets affordably and efficiently. Several countries’ carbon-pricing mechanisms include design features that allow the rate of emissions reductions to be accelerated if other countries take on more ambitious targets. Countries and regions that have implemented carbon-pricing mechanisms—for example, New Zealand and the European Union—are considering various options to link up their trading schemes

The European Union emissions trading scheme operated under an explicit trial phase between 2005 and 2007 and is currently in its first full phase, which runs from 2008 to 2012. The scheme covers more than 11,500 installations, which represent around half of Europe’s carbon dioxide emissions and about 40 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions. The 27 European Union member states, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, are covered by the scheme. New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme started in 2008, initially covering forestry. Transport fuels, electricity production and industrial processes were added on 1 July 2010. Transitional measures in place between July 2010 and December 2012 allow participants to buy emissions units from the New Zealand Government for a fixed price of NZ$25. At the same time, participants in the energy, industrial and liquid fossil fuel sectors are required to surrender only one emissions unit for every two tonnes of emissions they produce. The combined effect of these measures is to cap the price of emissions units at NZ$12.50 until the end of 2012. In 2010, the Japanese Government announced its intention to pass legislation that supported an emissions trading scheme, a carbon tax and feedin tariff measures. However, in late 2010, the government announced that it would delay, but not scrap, plans to implement an emissions trading scheme. A number of voluntary schemes exist in Japan. These include the Japanese voluntary scheme, which was launched in 2005, and the experimental scheme, launched in 2008. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government also launched an emissions trading scheme in April 2010. The Japanese private sector has taken big steps to put itself in a leading position technologically in the development of products and processes that are suitable to a low-carbon economy.4 Pledging the future | 59 In December 2009, the Republic of Korea’s National Assembly passed the Framework Act on Low-carbon Green Growth, which paves the way for a mandatory emissions trading scheme. While the scheme is still being developed, the Korean Presidential Committee on Green Growth has indicated that the first phase of the scheme may run from 2013 to 2015. A number of European countries beyond the Scandinavians, including the Netherlands and Switzerland, have implemented carbon taxes. The South African Government is also considering how to introduce a carbon price. Its National Treasury released a discussion paper in December 2010 exploring the economic rationale for, and possible approaches to, introducing a tax on carbon. In July 2010, India imposed a clean energy tax of 50 rupees per tonne (approximately A$1.13 per tonne) on both imported and domestically produced coal. Revenue from the tax will fund research and projects in clean energy technologies

A shift to a global carbon market suffered a blow when the Obama administration announced it would not pursue the passage of federal cap-and-trade legislation in 2010. but there have been considerable regional developments, with ten north-eastern and mid-Atlantic states now participating in a regional emissions trading scheme—the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. On 16 December 2010, the California Air Resources board approved a cap-and-trade plan for California to be implemented in January 2012. Only ten national economies are larger than California’s. This emissions trading scheme will be the world’s second largest (after the European Union’s) and aims to cut California’s emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. This roughly corresponds to a reduction of 6 per cent from 2000 levels. Of greater immediate significance, the US Environmental Protection Agency is pursuing aggressive regulatory measures, such as tightening regulatory restrictions on emissions from vehicles and mandating the closure of the most heavily polluting coal-fired power stations. Strong support for low-emissions sources of energy has been a feature of budget programs since the early stimulus packages in response to the Great Crash of 2008. In all of these measures, the Obama administration is following the reputable scientific community. With a Nobel laureate in physics, Stephen Chu, as energy secretary, the cabinet is confidently plugged into mainstream scientific thought. It is working on the basis that climate change is a reality, that human activity is contributing influentially to it, that the human community faces large risks of disruption to its economic and political life, and that the problem is an urgent one. 4

the United States added 361 gigawatts of power generation capacity, of which 70 per cent was gas-fired. Much of the new gas capacity was underutilised through a period in which gas prices were tending upwards with oil prices. It is now relatively easy and cheap to switch from coal-fired to gas-fired power generation. With greater regulatory pressure to close ‘dirty coal’ units, including some that are sources of high concentrations of mercury and particulates as well as greenhouse gases, there is considerable value in switching to gas-based power generation

Australia’s fair share The Australian Government and Opposition accepted the 2008 Review’s proposal that Australia should reduce emissions by 5 per cent in 2020 from 2000 levels whatever the rest of the world was doing as our contribution to keeping hopes for a strong international agreement alive. The Review recommended— and the government accepted—that Australia should also make pledges of stronger commitments calibrated to what other countries were doing. Australia should offer to reduce 2020 emissions by 25 per cent in the context of a strong international agreement focused on holding concentrations at 450 ppm corresponding to a temperature increase of about 2°C. If the world had reached effective agreement on emissions reductions that would lead to concentrations of 550 ppm, our fair share would have been 10 per cent. The conditional targets are crucial. The worry is that, on current trajectories, Australia would overshoot its Cancun 2020 target (even the minus 5 per cent target) by much more than other countries. That would be damaging to the global mitigation effort.64

The time to adjust targets would be following the government’s receipt in 2014 of the first report of the proposed independent committee (see Chapter  5). It would be appropriate for the target to be the percentage reduction of emissions which, within a contraction and convergence framework leading to equal entitlements per person in 2050, represents the average percentage reductions of the developed countries. The average would be weighted by population. The percentage would be based on pledges but adjusted for evidence of underperformance or overperformance against targets. The calculations would presume (as is currently the case) that the pledges of major developing countries add up to an equivalent reduction of emissions within a modified contraction and convergence framework. If they do not, there can be an appropriate adjustment of the target.

A similar historic choice confronts Australia now in its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, a market-based price on emissions reflects the costs that atmospheric carbon imposes on the rest of society and asks individuals and firms to adapt and create solutions that incorporate that price. The other approach is by regulation, through which f irms and individuals are required by law to refrain from emissions-intensive activity to an extent that adds up to the required reduction in emissions. In the latter approach, the government controls many consumption and production 68 | The Garnaut Review 2011 decisions by individuals and firms, based ideally on careful calculations of the activities that can reduce emissions at the least social cost

The 2008 Review recommended that, in the absence of an effective global agreement, Australia should introduce an emissions trading scheme geared to what others were doing but begin with a fixed price period. We would then be ready to define a target and to float the emissions permit price at some later time, when there were clear rules and opportunities for international trade in permits. Several clear principles must guide policy if a carbon price is effectively and efficiently to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. The principles are derived primarily from the objective of the policy—that is, to address the market failure of the cost that one firm’s greenhouse gas emissions imposes on others. n n n n n n n n environmental integrity—confidence that genuine emissions reductions have been achieved on the scale required cost-effectiveness—emissions reductions should be achieved at least cost to the community, by avoiding duplication and overlap with other policies, and using revenue from the scheme to reduce the costs of mitigation swift revision of the scheme in response to the recommendations of regular, transparent and independent reviews—sound, independent governance will increase the chances that the scheme moves to its optimal design over time autonomy—the scheme should minimise reliance on recurring judgments by government, and instead harness the efficiency of the market within an independently managed framework. 70

An emissions trading scheme with an initially fixed (and rising) price has some advantages. In the short term, a fixed price can provide steadiness, when a floating price would be volatile while the scheme remained the subject of fierce political dispute. It allows firms to become familiar with compliance under the scheme, and allows Australia to move towards a quantity constraint as knowledge of the scheme and confidence in its stability expand. Such an approach has the added benefit of gradually building industry capacity, and establishing and testing the necessary institutions and administrative infrastructure. International trade in abatement is a legitimate and important element of an efficient global solution to climate change. The eventual transition from a fixed to a floating price, as well as linking with other schemes, will assist in allowing emissions reductions to take place where they are cheapest. One advantage of emissions trading over a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme with a permanent fixed price is that it facilitates just such private international trade

Australia’s current policy settings and commitments are also relevant to a starting price. Australia has had an unconditional target since 2008 to reduce emissions by at least 5 per cent by 2020 (relative to 2000 levels). This target has bipartisan support. It became a commitment to the international community in Copenhagen in December 2009, and became part of a set of international agreements at Cancun in December 2010. Modelling suggests that to meet this target Australia’s carbon price would need to commence at around $26 in 2012

The targets allow unlimited permit imports, so Australia’s domestic emissions could exceed the number suggested by its target. The use of imported entitlements must depend on the integrity of the available international permits—they must represent real reductions in emissions in partner countries with hard targets and must not be counted against the targets of the countries from which they have been purchased. Trading partners should have a firm national target, whether calculated on a percentage reduction of emissions in a base year or a reduction in emissions intensity. The 5 per cent figure is a ‘net’ rather than domestic emissions reduction

Also relevant are explicit carbon prices in existing international markets and places where economy-wide carbon pricing policies are present. Future linking and trade in entitlements will occur more smoothly if the gap between Australian and overseas carbon prices is not too great. The current (May 2011) price of emissions permits in the European Union emissions trading scheme is around €17 (A$23) per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Another indication of suitable, and credible, prices for carbon is provided in economic analyses that guide regulatory decisions in the United States, where a systematic approach has been taken to these issues.

Prices to ensure the optimal depletion of a finite resource—in this case, the earth’s limited absorptive capacity—will increase over time at the rate of interest, as Hotelling concluded back in 1931.

The following conditions might be considered to be relevant to the timing of a shift to a floating price: n n n n Development of global agreements if sufficient countries (weighted by significance in the international economy and trade) take on emissions targets in the medium and long term. Following Cancun, this condition would seem to have been met, although it may be wise to wait and observe for a while the implementation of the Cancun agreements. Opportunities for trade. These may exist in substantial quantities, liquidity and stability in advance of the kind of global agreement envisaged in the 2008 Review. They could be nurtured through a regional agreement with neighbouring countries that are complementary to Australia. A regional market would need to be underpinned by emissions targets that represent each member’s fair share in a global effort, and in the short term by commitments that are proportional to comparable countries’ commitments. Trade with New Zealand, Indonesia, other ASEAN countries, Japan, Korea and Indonesia, and potentially Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and the South Pacific, may be relevant. Australia and Indonesia could discuss the merits of forming the core of a wider regional agreement. In developing countries with weak administrative systems, other countries would need to provide assistance with administration and compliance. Trade with the European Union and parts of North America may become relevant. However, the latter would probably be similar to Australia in seeking to purchase surplus emissions entitlements from others, and so trade with them would need to be within wider trading arrangements that included countries that were naturally net exporters of permits. 74 | The Garnaut Review 2011 n n The establishment of credibility and stability of the domestic scheme.

Voluntary action Voluntary emissions reductions by households and businesses should receive recognition in the administration of compliance with targets. As proposed by the government in its final Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme package in 2009, this can be achieved by allowing for voluntary purchase of offsets for emissions (for example, for air travel), ‘green power’ and other similar arrangements to be added back into the emissions base for purposes of compliance with international commitments.

It is sometimes suggested that providing households with assistance would cancel out the benefits of introducing a carbon price. It is said that, if we impose a carbon price that costs a household $100 and then provide that household with a tax cut worth $100, nothing has changed. These suggestions are wrong. The carbon price, even with the tax cut, alters the relative prices of more and less emissions-intensive goods and services. High-emissions goods become more expensive relative to low-emissions goods. Demand for the former falls, while demand for the latter rises. And putting a price on emissions encourages producers to use less emissions-intensive processes to produce goods and services

A carbon price of $26 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent would generate around $11.5 billion in potential revenue from the value of permits in 2012–13. The amount of revenue rises with the carbon price, but falls as emissions decrease. The revenue from a carbon price is expected to rise for a decade or so. In the longer term, the revenue from a carbon price will stabilise and then start to decline as a result of steady falls in emissions eventually overcoming the rise in permit prices

Efficiency and equity objectives would be well served by allocating much of the revenue to reducing personal income tax rates on households at the lower end of the income distribution. This could be the kind of tax and social security reforms envisaged in the Henry review. Such an adjustment would increase incentives to participate in the labour force at a time when Australia faces shortages of labour and inflationary pressures. There can be a substantial reduction in the disincentives to work created by the interaction of taxation and the withdrawal of pensions and benefits. Second, for those low-income households that do not stand to benefit from tax cuts, adjustments could be made to indexation arrangements for pensions and benefits that protect against disproportionate increases in the prices of particular goods and services that these households consume in unusually high proportions. Full compensation and not overcompensation should be the objective. Third, any additional inequities would need to be corrected by targeted support for households with exceptional energy requirements for health and other reasons. Fourth, part of the revenue should be used for firms or the carbon pricing scheme regulator to purchase carbon credits from the land sector. Fifth, there is a case for assisting the trade-exposed industries to an extent that offsets the effects on product prices of other countries having carbon constraints that impose lower costs than Australia’s.

There have been considerable concerns about the distributional effects of increases in petrol prices associated with carbon pricing, particularly for those living in outer suburban and regional areas. It is not obvious how these effects can be simply compensated at reasonable transactions costs. They are actually small in relation to incomes and compared with the effects of variations in world oil prices. In the meantime, the increase in petrol prices following the introduction of a carbon price could be offset through a one-off reduction in petrol excise, funded by other tax adjustments that had similar or larger positive effects on emissions. The cost of a one-off reduction in excise at the time of introducing carbon pricing could be covered by reform or abolition of the preferential treatment of the fringe benefits tax arrangements related to private vehicle use, and the reduction in other subsidies for fossil fuel consumption. The fringe benefits arrangements were identified as being highly distortionary by the Henry review. Under these arrangements, the taxable value of a car’s fringe benefit falls at specific intervals as the distance driven increases. This arrangement encourages more driving than would otherwise be the case and therefore increases emissions. Abolition of the concessional treatment of fringe benefits in the form of private use of corporate vehicles would pay for the initial removal of the effects of the carbon tax on petrol and diesel. If reform rather than abolition were adopted by government, as in the 2011 budget, the balance of the costs could be covered by removal or reform of other taxation arrangements that encourage the use of fossil fuels. For the future, the smaller incremental increases in carbon prices could be compensated through additional rounds of tax cuts, when the scheme as a whole would be contributing positively to rural incomes

Some households use higher proportions of their income on electricity, gas and other goods and services that are particularly emissions-intensive and so experience especially large increases in costs. Some low-income households use much more electricity and gas than others, because some members have health problems or disabilities requiring special treatment. This was one reason why the government’s proposals for an emissions trading scheme in 2009 provided for ‘overcompensation’ of low-income households

It would be better to deal with the problem of undercompensation of households with special energy requirements directly. Households with special energy requirements can be identified through state and territory governments and private organisations, and provided with lump sums that compensate for their exceptional requirements without removing incentives to reduce energy use. This will deal with the problem more reliably, while leaving more revenue for productivity-raising taxation reform for workers on low and middle incomes

First, imposing a carbon price in Australia ahead of similar carbon constraints in our trade competitors, if it were to occur, could result in some movement of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries from Australia to other countries that impose less of a carbon constraint. This could result in an increase in global emissions—in the event that the activity moves to a country that uses a more emissions-intensive production process than Australia. This is the universally recognised environmental risk of carbon leakage. This risk is difficult to quantify precisely. Analyses in Australia, Europe and the United States consistently suggest that the risk is real, but exaggerated in popular discussion. We should recognise that not all movement of production from Australia to other countries would involve carbon leakage. For example, Australian aluminium production is among the most emissionsintensive in the world, as it is mainly based on coal, some of it brown coal with exceptionally high emissions. The expansion of aluminium smelting elsewhere in response to reduced smelting in Australia is likely to generate electricity from water flows or natural gas, with zero or low emissions

Second, if Australia were to impose a cost on carbon emissions which preceded or exceeded that of countries that are the hosts to major competitors, this could cause Australian production to contract below the level that would eventuate when our competitor countries faced a similar cost. Such a loss in productive capacity would be inefficient and costly to regain at a later date when most countries were imposing carbon constraints with similar costs to Australia’s

First, assistance will be of a transitional nature pending comparable carbon pricing in the rest of the world. Second, assistance should only compensate for the inefficient distortion arising from an uncoordinated global start to emissions reduction, with sales prices for emissions-intensive goods being lower than they would be if all countries imposed similar carbon restraints to Australia. This means that assistance to all firms should be withdrawn once most countries are imposing similar carbon constraints. Some countries may continue to assist specific sectors and to create distortions even after most countries are imposing similar constraints. Such counter-subsidising would contribute to a destructive, reinforcing cycle of protectionism. It is important for Australia to work with other countries to secure international application of sound principles to avoid continuing distortion. The 2008 Review described an approach to assistance based on avoiding the transfer out of Australia of production that would remain if other countries imposed similar carbon constraints to Australia. I called this the ‘principled approach’

An independent agency should be responsible for developing the approach to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry assistance beyond the first three years of the scheme. The agency would have features similar to the Productivity Commission and could be the Productivity Commission. The agency should be asked to review the new approach, and to vary it in the light of analysis and experience if variations would raise the incomes and welfare of Australians. It should develop a suitable work program to ensure priority sectors are considered early, in anticipation of the switch to the new, principled approach. Priority should be given to data collection and analysis on emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries, which are receiving the largest amount of assistance. Once a move from the interim to the new approach has been made, the agency should continue to provide advice on the operation of the assistance regime, including advice on when global carbon pricing has progressed to the point where there is no longer an economic justification for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry assistance for Australian firms. The independent agency would be backed with the necessary resources and would have the professional capacity to do this job well. It would operate transparently in the manner of the Productivity Commission, exposing its methodology and data sources for public comment. Assistance provided to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries to correct for undesirable and inefficient outcomes should not be confused with providing support to industry for the loss of profits or asset value arising from the introduction of a carbon price in Australia. Any fall in asset value 86 | The Garnaut Review 2011 stemming from the change in relative pricing creates no greater case for compensation than other government reforms to reduce other market failures. The introduction of measures to discourage smoking, to control the use of asbestos, to raise occupational health and safety and environmental standards, and to reduce lead in petrol are all cases in point.

The land sector For good reason, agriculture and the land sector will not be comprehensively covered by carbon pricing in the early years. There are large advantages in allowing genuine sequestration in the land sector to be rewarded at the carbon price, whether or not that is currently allowed under the international rules developed at Kyoto and currently under discussion with a view to modification. There is great uncertainty about the claims that the land sector may make on carbon revenue, but they are potentially large. Chapter 10 suggests that, pending full coverage of the land sector in carbon pricing, provision be made for a proportion of the carbon revenue to be allocated for land sector credits

The government is currently allocating about three-quarters of a billion dollars a year to innovation in low-emissions technologies through the three-year forward estimates and beyond. This funding will presumably continue, so that the carbon pricing package has to fund only the increase above three-quarters of a billion.

ConclusionThe carbon pricing scheme will generate large amounts of revenue—about 20 per cent of that collected by the goods and services tax. With careful use, the revenue can fully compensate low- and middle-income earners for the costs of the scheme while supporting a substantial efficiency-improving tax reform. At the same time, it can support assistance to avoid uneconomic reduction of production in emissions-intensive industries, incentives for large-scale utilisation of opportunities for biosequestration in the land sector, and fiscal incentives for innovation in low-emissions technologies. Some funds would be made available for structural adjustment if it emerged that there 88 | The Garnaut Review 2011 were regions in which economic activity and employment were hit heavily by carbon pricing. Provision would be made for the possibility that loan guarantees to secure energy security were called through the early years of transition to a low-emissions economy. The total potential revenue would include proceeds of sales of about 10 per cent of one year’s permits in each year, for use at any time from three years after issue. This would support the emergence of a forward market in deliverable permits. It would increase net revenues from the sale of permits in the first three years of the scheme. Over time, tax cuts for households, innovation and land sequestration would draw gradually more deeply on the revenues. Investing carbon revenue in these ways would boost economic growth and the resilience of our economy overall. Requirements for assistance to trade-exposed industries would gradually fall, as other countries’ carbon constraints tightened, and were taken into account more accurately in Australian arrangements

but fast forward again to 2011 and we find a new generation of the business Council has reverted to its old type. In April, the chairman of the business Council, Graham bradley, visited China alongside a visit by the Australian prime minister. During high-level discussions with senior government and business leaders, Mr bradley said that the business Council would not support any carbon tax that would ‘discourage investment’ in Australia. And there should be no carbon tax on natural gas
