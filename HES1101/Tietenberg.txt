Emissions Trading: Principles and Practice, 2nd edition, 2006
T. H. Tietenberg
9 chapters, 207 pages

1 - INTRODUCTION

p1
reduce emissions or acquire emissions from elsewhere.

p2
by late 50s, economists (Pigou) believed should tax per-unit externalities
    like pollution

    politicians: regulate, how much for each emitter, mandate technologies, 
        penalties for non-compliance (command-and-control)
        economists believe not cost-effective.

p3
Coase (1960)
make property rights that are transferable, market to value property

p4
transferability leads to reductions by those who can do it at least cost

p5
traditional approach
bureaucrats choose control technologies, enforcing limits
emissions trading: burden on control strategy moves from govt to polluter
firms who can do more, do so and sell to others.

p6
allows flexibility in timing of cuts vs enforcing all do at same time
(Atkinson and Lewis 1974, Tietenberg 1974)
old approach is cost ineffective

** OFFSET POLICY
1976

EPA - faced with not allowing new businesses (more growth), due to areas
    already not meeting requirements, and new ones would increase it.
p7
    existing could voluntary cut below limit, and get certified and transferred
    new business needed to enquire 120% of needs (20% retired)

** The US Emissions Trading Program: Expanding the Scope
ETP
3 new additions:
- bubble
    existing sources can acquire from each other, not just for new sources.
- banking
    save credits for later use or sale.
- netting
    when modifiying or expanding, don't have to meet strict requirements of new
        sources, keep net increase below a threshold

p8
** Lead Phase Out
lead out of gasoline
easier to administer on source of lead at refinery, than each vehicle 
$36 bill savings in health, for $2.6 bill cost for refineries.
more costly for some than others to implement 
fixed amount of lead rights given out, could sell if didn't need to use it
only neede for a few years
on an input, not an emission
designed to eliminate input, not reduce below limit
phase out happened earlier than old method (would have to set date that all
    could meet)

p9
** Reducing Ozone-Depleting Chemicals
Montreal Protocol on CFC need to be eliminated
US used transferable permit system

p10
1st system to allow international trade

** Tackling Acid Rain: The Sulfur Allowance Program
for power plants emitting sulfur
reduce by 10 mill tons by 2010 from 1980
most successful to date


sulfur dioxide allowances given out
can use allowance in future year
per-ton penalty if go over, plus forfeit same amount next year
penalty $2000 / ton indexed to inflation
innovation of an auction market
p12
allows anyone to buy, can buy and retire

** RECLAIM: The States Take the Initiative
$45,000 per ton spike, normally at $4,284

p13
** The NOx Budget Program

p14
** Emissions Trading in the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change
5 years (2008-12) for meeting individual country targets
    "assigned amount obligations" set out in Annex B
    multiply 1990 level by reduction factor * 5 (for years)
    collectively add up to 5%

p15

3 cooperative implementation mechanism
- ET - Emissions Trading
    trading among Annex B countries (mostly developed)
- JI - Joint Implementation
    finance projects in other Annex B, for countries not fully eligble for ET
- CDM - Clean Development Mechanism
    Annex B finance project in non-Annex B
    
p16
** The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme
largest
25 countries includeing 10 accession countries (mostly former soviet)
1st phase, 2005-7 trial phase
2nd phase, 2008-12, Kyoto Period
initially only 4 broad sectors: iron & steel, minerals, energy, pulp & paper.
    include sectors larger than specific thresholds
    12,000 installations 
individual countries set initial allocations by 2-step processes
    - how much of predefined cap to each sector
    - how much allocation to each installation within the sector
        controversial! different cost for competitors in different countries
allocations of permits free, may be auctioned in the future
    up to 5% auctioned in 1st phase
    up to 10% in 2nd
Can use credits from outside EU (JI or CDM) 


p20

lower costs, or lower reductions at same cost
